## Prerequisites 

To participate in the summer school students need to master the **basics in Linear Algebra and Analysis** and have an **advanced level in Python programming**.

Preparatory material to reach a bsaic level in **Machine Learning** will be distributed beforehand. It is expected that the students prepare themselves with these documents for the summer school.

English Level B2 is compulsory.

## Programme structure 
During the mornings, you will receive inputs and lectures, followed by structured excercises in a lab. In the afternoon you will work in teams on a challenge /task as project work.

At the end of week two (part ZHAW SoE), the teams will present their solutions to a jury.

Topical and touristic excursion complement the academic curriculum.
